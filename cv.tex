\section{interests}
I'm a maker at heart and have a strong background in wireless sensor networks and computer science. My interests go out to electronic hardware design, research and (rapid) prototyping. I'm looking for more experience in supply chain logistics for consumer products. In all I'm a solution driven person, eager to learn and feel comfortable in a fast changing environment.
